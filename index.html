            <h1 id="headerRight">Leaflet</h1>
            <div class="AboutUs" id="leafletPart">
                <img src="Images/leafletlogo.png" id="leafLogo">
                <p>Leaflet is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for creating mobile-friendly interactive maps and web-based mapping applications. It was first released in 2011 and has since grown to become one of the most widely used mapping libraries on the web.
                <br><br>Leaflet provides an easy-to-use interface for working with maps and offers a range of features and options for customizing the appearance and functionality of maps. Some of the key features of Leaflet include:
                    
                    <br><br>• Marker and layer support: Leaflet allows you to add markers, popups, and various types of layers to your map, making it easy to display different types of data and information.
                    <br>• Custom map styling: With Leaflet, you can customize the appearance of your map by changing the colors, adding labels, and adjusting the zoom level and center point.
                    <br>• Interactivity: Leaflet provides support for various types of interactivity, including panning, zooming, and clicking on markers and layers.
                    <br>• Mobile support: Leaflet is designed to work well on mobile devices, with support for touch gestures and responsive design.
                    <br>• Plugin ecosystem: Leaflet has a large and active plugin ecosystem, with a wide range of plugins available for adding additional functionality to your maps.
   
                <br><br>Leaflet is often used in combination with other web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Its popularity and ease of use make it a great choice for creating interactive maps and web-based mapping applications.

            <h1>Cultural Spaces Inventory</h1>
            <div class="AboutUs">
                <p>These data were gathered by Apartment 613 Community Initiatives as part of a project with the City of Ottawa to build an updated inventory of spaces for cultural activities and events (broadly defined) in Ottawa. This project was an update to previous cultural mapping projects, such as Ottawa XYZ and the Cultural Experiences Inventory, and is related to Section 2.2.6 of the Official Plan.
                <br><br><b>Accuracy</b>
                <br>“Culture” is a complicated concept. It can mean many different things. Therefore, there is no simple answer to the question of what constitutes a space for cultural activities or events. The project partners used a broad definition that includes spaces in several categories, including venues,
                studios, learning spaces, community spaces (including places of worship), food, sport, stores, heritage, nature (including parks), and public art. The project is ongoing and we are always open to suggestions on how to improve this dataset. The City will be maintaining this dataset going forward, and we may revisit the categorization and types of spaces we include in the future.
                When using these data, it is important to keep in the mind the following:
                <br>1. Not all categories are necessarily relevant to all users for all purposes.
                <br>2. The dataset, while extensive (3,800+ spaces), may not be exhaustive. If you notice anything that is missing, please contact the Data Steward.
                <br>3. Change occurs frequently. The City will be developing a plan for the long-term maintenance of this dataset. The data will be updated frequently, but there can be outdated information. If you notice anything that is out-of-date, please contact the Data Steward.
                <br>4. The fields called “Size (Capacity/# seats)” and “Accessibility” have not yet been populated, as the research is still ongoing.
                <br><br><b>Update Frequency:</b> As needed
